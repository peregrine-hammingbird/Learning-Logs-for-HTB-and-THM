# Hack The Box - Starting Point Tier1 : Crocodile

## Overview
Crocodile is a Starting Point machine focused on **enumeration**, **credential discovery**, and **credential reuse** across services (FTP → Web).

---

## Enumeration
### Nmap Scan
nmap -sC -sV MACHINE_IP
FTP (port 21) discovered
Web service running on port 80

FTP Enumeration
Logged into the FTP service and downloaded available files.
From FTP, obtained:
Username list
Password list
These credentials were later reused against the web service.

Web Enumeration
Performed directory brute-forcing to identify authentication endpoints.

gobuster dir -u http://MACHINE_IP -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -x php
Note: Gobuster initially timed out due to server instability.
Restarting the machine resolved the issue.

Discovered
/login.php

Exploitation
Accessed the login page:http://MACHINE_IP/login.php

Used credentials obtained from FTP:
Username: admin
Password: (from FTP password list)
Successfully authenticated and retrieved the flag.

Key Takeaways
Importance of proper service enumeration
Credential reuse between different services is a common real-world issue
Handling tooling issues (timeouts) and identifying environment-related problems
Methodical approach over brute force
