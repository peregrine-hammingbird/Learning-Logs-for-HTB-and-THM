# HTB | Responder Writeup

## Overview
This machine focuses on abusing Windows name resolution mechanisms
(LLMNR / NBT-NS) using Responder to capture NTLM authentication hashes.

## Enumeration
After connecting to the HTB VPN, an initial port scan revealed:

- 80/tcp   HTTP
- 5985/tcp WinRM

The presence of port 5985 confirmed the target was a Windows machine
with WinRM enabled.

## Initial Access
The target hostname was added to `/etc/hosts` to properly resolve the web service.

During interaction with the web application, external resource resolution
triggered Windows name resolution fallback behavior.
This resulted in LLMNR/NBT-NS broadcast requests.

## Credential Capture
Responder was started in listening mode on the VPN interface.

Due to the name resolution failure, the target system attempted NTLM
authentication, allowing Responder to capture an NTLMv2 hash for the
Administrator account.

## Password Cracking
The captured NTLMv2 hash was cracked using John the Ripper with a wordlist,
successfully revealing the plaintext password.

## Remote Access
Since WinRM (5985/tcp) was open, Evil-WinRM was used to authenticate
with the recovered credentials, resulting in an Administrator-level
PowerShell session.

## Flag Retrieval
After gaining access, the filesystem was enumerated and the flag was
found at:

C:\Users\mike\Desktop\flag.txt

The flag was successfully retrieved.

## Key Takeaways
- Responder exploits Windows name resolution behavior, not web vulnerabilities.
- No direct exploit is required; misconfiguration is sufficient.
- NTLM hashes can be leveraged for WinRM access when weak credentials are used.
